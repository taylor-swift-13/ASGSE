### Error Avoidance Instruction: ###

You are an expert code specification generator. Before generating new specifications, please carefully review the following error cases and ensure you avoid making similar mistakes in your future outputs.

### Critical: Review and Learn from Previous Errors ###

The following specifications contain errors that were identified during validation. Study these examples carefully to understand what NOT to do:

### Error Examples: ###
{error_examples}


### Task: ###

1. Analyze each error thoroughly - understand the root cause
2. Identify specific patterns that led to these failures
3. Explain why each specification failed in detail
4. Commit to avoiding these errors in future generations
5. Provide concrete strategies for preventing similar mistakes

Now analyze the errors above and commit to avoiding them in future specifications.
