2025-09-11 01:53:14,340 - INFO  - think in natural language:  I'll perform a comprehensive static analysis of this C code, which appears to implement an integer square root algorithm using Newton's method.

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose**: This loop implements the Newton-Raphson method for computing the integer square root of `n`. It iteratively refines a guess until it converges to the best integer approximation of √n.

**Structure**: 
- **Loop condition**: `guess != prev_guess` - continues until the guess stabilizes
- **Loop body operations**:
  1. Store current guess as previous guess: `prev_guess = guess`
  2. Compute new guess using Newton's formula: `guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2`
- **Relevant variables**:
  - `n`: Input value (constant, n > 0)
  - `guess`: Current approximation, initialized to `n/2`
  - `prev_guess`: Previous iteration's guess, initialized to 0

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let me trace through with n = 16 as an example:

**Pre-Loop Sampling**:
- `n = 16`
- `guess = 16/2 = 8`
- `prev_guess = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling**:

*After iteration 1*:
- `prev_guess = 8`
- `guess = (8 + 16/8) / 2 = (8 + 2) / 2 = 5`

*After iteration 2*:
- `prev_guess = 5`  
- `guess = (5 + 16/5) / 2 = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4`

*After iteration 3*:
- `prev_guess = 4`
- `guess = (4 + 16/4) / 2 = (4 + 4) / 2 = 4`

**Post-Loop Sampling**:
- Loop terminates because `guess == prev_guess` (both equal 4)
- Final values: `guess = 4`, `prev_guess = 4`, `n = 16`

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal**: `guess * guess <= n`

**Can the verification goal serve as loop invariant?**
**NO** - The verification goal cannot be directly used as a loop invariant because:

1. It's not always true during iterations. In the early iterations, the guess might be too large, making `guess * guess > n`.
2. From our sample: after iteration 1, `guess = 8` and `8 * 8 = 64 > 16`, violating the condition.

**Modified Invariant Proposal**:
The verification goal needs to be enhanced to create a valid invariant. A suitable modification would be:
- `guess > 0 && (guess == prev_guess ==> guess * guess <= n < (guess + 1) * (guess + 1))`

This ensures that when the loop terminates (convergence), we have the correct integer square root property.

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant** (in natural language):
"The current guess is always positive, and if the algorithm has converged (guess equals prev_guess), then guess is the integer square root of n (i.e., guess² ≤ n < (guess+1)²)."

**Why this invariant is valid**:
- It's weak enough to hold during all iterations (doesn't require the final condition during intermediate steps)
- It's strong enough that when combined with loop termination, it proves the post-condition
- The Newton's method ensures monotonic convergence for integer square roots

## e. Establishment

The invariant is established before the first iteration:
- `guess = n/2 > 0` (since n > 0 from precondition)
- Initially `guess != prev_guess` (8 ≠ 0), so the convergence condition doesn't need to hold yet
- The invariant trivially holds since the implication's antecedent is false

## f. Preservation

**Preservation proof**:
Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration i. During the iteration:

1. `prev_guess = guess` (both positive)
2. `guess = (guess + n/guess) / 2`

The new guess remains positive because:
- `guess > 0` and `n > 0`, so `n/guess > 0`
- Therefore `(guess + n/guess) / 2 > 0`

If convergence occurs in this iteration (`new_guess == prev_guess`), then the Newton's method properties guarantee that this converged value is the integer square root.

## g. Termination Analysis

**Loop terminates when**: `guess == prev_guess`

**Variable states at termination**:
- `guess = prev_guess = integer_square_root_of_n`
- Both variables contain the same positive value
- This value satisfies: `guess² ≤ n < (guess+1)²`

The invariant remains valid because the convergence condition now holds, and Newton's method ensures the mathematical property is satisfied.

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**The post-condition `guess * guess <= n` is CORRECT**.

**Proof**: 
When the loop terminates:
1. The invariant holds: `guess > 0 && (guess == prev_guess ==> guess² ≤ n < (guess+1)²)`
2. The loop condition is false: `guess == prev_guess` 
3. From (1) and (2): `guess² ≤ n < (guess+1)²`
4. Therefore: `guess * guess <= n` ✓

The invariant, combined with loop termination, directly implies the post-condition. The algorithm correctly computes the floor of the square root of n.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:

- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-09-11 01:53:22,050 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this C code implementing Newton's method for integer square root, I need to identify the appropriate loop invariant that will help verify the post-condition `guess * guess <= n`.

Let me analyze what needs to be maintained throughout the loop:

1. The variables `guess` and `prev_guess` must remain positive
2. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its original value
3. When the loop terminates (convergence), the result should satisfy the square root property

Based on the Newton's method algorithm and the convergence properties, here's the complete code with the loop invariant:

```c
/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */
    
int hoo35(int n) {
       
    int guess;      
    int prev_guess; 
    guess = n / 2;  
    prev_guess = 0; 

    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
            loop invariant guess > 0 && prev_guess >= 0 && n > 0;
            loop assigns guess, prev_guess;
            */
            while (guess != prev_guess) {
        prev_guess = guess;
        guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2;  
    }
            
    
    /*@ assert guess * guess <= n; */
}
```

2025-09-11 01:53:31,954 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this C code implementing Newton's method for integer square root, I need to fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants and assignments.

Analyzing the loop behavior:
- `prev_guess` gets updated to the current `guess` value
- `guess` gets updated using the Newton's method formula
- `n` remains constant throughout
- We need to track the relationship between these variables

Here's the complete code with the placeholders filled:

```c
/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */
    
int hoo35(int n) {
       
    int guess;      
    int prev_guess; 
    guess = n / 2;  
    prev_guess = 0;

          loop assigns guess, prev_guess;
            */
            while (guess != prev_guess) {
        prev_guess = guess;
        guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2;  
    }

2025-09-11 01:53:46,844 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this C code implementing Newton's method for integer square root, I need to analyze whether the verification goal `guess * guess <= n` can be used directly as a loop invariant.

Let me trace through the algorithm:
- Initial: `guess = n/2`, `prev_guess = 0`
- For n = 16: `guess = 8`, so `8 * 8 = 64 > 16`

The verification goal `guess * guess <= n` does NOT hold throughout the loop - it's violated in early iterations when the guess is too large. Therefore, I cannot use it directly as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`.

Instead, I need to use a weaker condition that holds throughout but strengthens to the verification goal upon termination.

```c
/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */
    
int hoo35(int n) {
       
    int guess;      
    int prev_guess; 
    guess = n / 2;  
    prev_guess = 0;
