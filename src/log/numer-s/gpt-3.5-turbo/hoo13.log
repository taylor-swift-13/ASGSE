#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose**:  
The purpose of the loop in the function `hoo13` is to repeatedly toggle the value of the variable `x` between 1 and 2. This is controlled by the loop condition, which is determined by the function `unknown()`. The loop continues to execute as long as `unknown()` returns true.

**Structure**:  
- **Governing Condition**: The loop is governed by `while (unknown())`. This condition determines whether the loop will continue executing.
- **Operations**: Inside the loop, there are two conditional statements:
  - If `x` is 1, it is set to 2.
  - If `x` is 2, it is set to 1.
- **Relevant Variables**: The only relevant variable in the loop is `x`, which can take values of either 1 or 2 based on the initial pre-condition and the operations performed in the loop.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:  
  Before the loop starts, `x` can either be 1 or 2, as per the pre-condition `requires x == 1 || x == 2;`.  
  - Sample: `x = 1` (or `x = 2`).

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:  
  After each iteration, we analyze the value of `x`:
  1. **Iteration 1**: If `x = 1`, then `x` becomes 2. If `x = 2`, then `x` becomes 1.
     - Sample: `x = 2` (or `x = 1`).
  2. **Iteration 2**: If `x = 2`, then `x` becomes 1. If `x = 1`, then `x` becomes 2.
     - Sample: `x = 1` (or `x = 2`).
  3. **Iteration 3**: Continues toggling.
     - Sample: `x = 2` (or `x = 1`).
  4. **Iteration 4**: Continues toggling.
     - Sample: `x = 1` (or `x = 2`).
  5. **Iteration 5**: Continues toggling.
     - Sample: `x = 2` (or `x = 1`).

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:  
  The loop continues indefinitely as long as `unknown()` returns true. If it eventually returns false, the last sampled value of `x` will still be either 1 or 2.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant**:  
At the start of each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is always either 1 or 2.

**Explanation of Validity**:  
This invariant holds because:
- The pre-condition guarantees that `x` starts as either 1 or 2.
- The operations inside the loop only toggle `x` between these two values. Thus, regardless of how many times the loop iterates, `x` will never take on any value outside of this set.

#### e. Establishment

**Establishment of the Invariant**:  
Before the first iteration of the loop, the pre-condition ensures that `x` is either 1 or 2. Thus, the invariant holds true at the beginning of the first iteration.

**Guarantee by Pre-condition**:  
The pre-condition `requires x == 1 || x == 2;` ensures that the invariant is established before the loop starts.

#### f. Preservation

**Preservation of the Invariant**:  
During each iteration, if the invariant holds (i.e., `x` is either 1 or 2), the operations performed in the loop (toggling `x`) will maintain this invariant. After each iteration:
- If `x` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `x` was 2, it becomes 1.
Thus, after each iteration, `x` remains either 1 or 2.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables Upon Termination**:  
When the loop terminates, it is because `unknown()` returns false. At this point, `x` will still be either 1 or 2 due to the invariant holding throughout the loop's execution.

**Invariant Validity on Termination**:  
The loop invariant remains valid upon termination because it does not depend on the loop condition. It simply states that `x` is either 1 or 2, which is guaranteed by the operations in the loop.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition**:  
The provided post-condition states `assert x <= 8;`. This is correct because the only possible values for `x` are 1 and 2, both of which satisfy this condition.

**Linking Invariant and Post-condition**:  
Since the loop invariant guarantees that `x` is always either 1 or 2, when the loop terminates (i.e., when `unknown()` returns false), the post-condition `x <= 8` is trivially satisfied. The invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition ensures that the final value of `x` will always meet the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not add loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.

- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.


- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) == 2 && x == \at(x,Pre) || \at(x,Pre) == 1 && x == \at(x,Pre)`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x == 1 || x == 2;
    */
    
int hoo13(int x){

    //loop-body
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == \at(x,Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_FOR_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (unknown()) {
        if(x == 1) 
            x = 2;
        else if(x == 2)
            x = 1;
    }
            

    //post-condition
    /*@ assert x <= 8; */
}`

2025-09-07 11:35:05,213 - DEBUG  - Role:
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not add loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.


- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) == 2 && x == \at(x,Pre) || \at(x,Pre) == 1 && x == \at(x,Pre)`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x == 1 || x == 2;

          loop invariant  ((x == \at(x,Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;

            */

            x = 1;
    }
