#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose**:  
  The loop iterates through values of `x` from 1 to 100, incrementing `x` by 1 in each iteration. In each iteration, the variable `y` is updated to `100 - x`. The purpose of the loop is to compute and update `y` based on the current value of `x` during each iteration.

- **Structure**:  
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (x <= 100)` ensures the loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.  
  - **Operations in the Body**:  
    - `y = 100 - x;` computes the difference between 100 and the current value of `x`.  
    - `x = x + 1;` increments `x` by 1.  
  - **Relevant Variables**:  
    - `x`: Starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.  
    - `y`: Updated in each iteration to reflect `100 - x`.  

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:  
  - Before the loop begins:  
    - `x = 1` (initialized to 1).  
    - `y` is uninitialized at this point.  

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:  
  - **After Iteration 1**:  
    - `x = 2` (incremented by 1).  
    - `y = 100 - 1 = 99`.  
  - **After Iteration 2**:  
    - `x = 3`.  
    - `y = 100 - 2 = 98`.  
  - **After Iteration 3**:  
    - `x = 4`.  
    - `y = 100 - 3 = 97`.  
  - **After Iteration 4**:  
    - `x = 5`.  
    - `y = 100 - 4 = 96`.  
  - **After Iteration 5**:  
    - `x = 6`.  
    - `y = 100 - 5 = 95`.  

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:  
  - When the loop terminates (i.e., `x > 100`):  
    - `x = 101` (the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false).  
    - `y = 100 - 100 = 0` (the final value of `y` is computed based on the last valid iteration when `x = 100`).  

---

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**:  
  At the beginning and end of every iteration, the value of `y` satisfies:  
  `y = 100 - x`.  

- **Explanation**:  
  - The invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` that is consistently maintained throughout the loop.  
  - At the start of the loop, `x = 1`, and the first computation of `y` (`y = 100 - x`) ensures the invariant holds true.  
  - In each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is updated accordingly (`y = 100 - x`), ensuring the invariant remains valid.  

---

#### e. Establishment ####

- **How the Invariant is Established**:  
  - Before the first iteration, `x` is initialized to 1, and the first computation of `y` (`y = 100 - x`) ensures the invariant holds.  
  - At this point:  
    - `x = 1`.  
    - `y = 100 - x = 99`.  

- **Pre-condition Guarantee**:  
  - The pre-condition for this loop is implicit in the initialization of `x` (`x = 1`). This guarantees that the invariant is established before the loop begins.  

---

#### f. Preservation ####

- **How the Invariant is Preserved**:  
  - At the beginning of each iteration, the invariant holds (`y = 100 - x`).  
  - During the iteration:  
    - `x` is incremented (`x = x + 1`).  
    - `y` is updated to reflect the new value of `x` (`y = 100 - x`).  
  - At the end of the iteration, the invariant still holds because the relationship `y = 100 - x` remains true after the update.  

- **Demonstration**:  
  - Suppose the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (`y = 100 - x`).  
  - After the update:  
    - `x_new = x + 1`.  
    - `y_new = 100 - x_new = 100 - (x + 1)`.  
  - This computation ensures the invariant (`y = 100 - x`) remains valid for the next iteration.  

---

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **State of Variables at Termination**:  
  - The loop terminates when `x > 100`.  
  - At this point:  
    - `x = 101`.  
    - `y = 100 - 100 = 0` (computed during the last valid iteration when `x = 100`).  

- **Invariant Validity at Termination**:  
  - The invariant (`y = 100 - x`) remains valid up to the last iteration when `x = 100`.  
  - When the loop terminates, the invariant is no longer applicable since the loop condition (`x <= 100`) is false.  

---

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Post-condition Evaluation**:  
  - The post-condition asserts: `y >= 0`.  
  - This is correct because:  
    - During the loop, `y = 100 - x`, and `x` ranges from 1 to 100.  
    - For all valid values of `x` within this range, `y` is non-negative (`100 - x >= 0`).  
    - At termination, `y = 0`, which satisfies the post-condition (`y >= 0`).  

- **Proof Using Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition**:  
  - The invariant ensures `y = 100 - x` during the loop.  
  - When the loop terminates, `x > 100`. The last valid value of `x` is 100, which results in `y = 100 - 100 = 0`.  
  - Thus, the post-condition (`y >= 0`) is guaranteed to hold.  

---

### Final Remarks ###

The loop invariant (`y = 100 - x`) is valid and ensures the correctness of the loop's behavior. The post-condition (`y >= 0`) is correct and is proven by the invariant and the termination condition.

- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
