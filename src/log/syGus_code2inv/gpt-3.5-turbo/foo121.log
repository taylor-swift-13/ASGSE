2025-09-06 23:49:26,887 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo121` is to count from 1 to 8, incrementing a counter variable `sn` for each iteration. The intended outcome is to ensure that `sn` equals 8 after the loop completes, which indicates that the loop has iterated exactly 8 times.

The loop's structure is defined by the condition `while (i <= 8)`, which governs the execution of the loop. Inside the loop, two operations are performed:
1. `i = (i + 1);` - This increments the variable `i` by 1 in each iteration.
2. `sn = (sn + 1);` - This increments the variable `sn` by 1 in each iteration.

The relevant variables are:
- `i`: Starts at 1 and is incremented until it exceeds 8.
- `sn`: Starts at 0 and counts the number of iterations, incrementing by 1 each time the loop executes.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop begins:
  - `i = 1`
  - `sn = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. After Iteration 1:
   - `i = 2`
   - `sn = 1`
   
2. After Iteration 2:
   - `i = 3`
   - `sn = 2`
   
3. After Iteration 3:
   - `i = 4`
   - `sn = 3`
   
4. After Iteration 4:
   - `i = 5`
   - `sn = 4`
   
5. After Iteration 5:
   - `i = 6`
   - `sn = 5`

6. After Iteration 6:
   - `i = 7`
   - `sn = 6`

7. After Iteration 7:
   - `i = 8`
   - `sn = 7`

8. After Iteration 8:
   - `i = 9`
   - `sn = 8`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- After the loop terminates:
  - `i = 9`
  - `sn = 8`

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, `sn = i - 1`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant states that the value of `sn` is always equal to `i - 1` at the start of each iteration. This is valid because:
- Initially, when `i = 1`, `sn = 0`, satisfying `sn = i - 1`.
- With each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `sn` is also incremented by 1, maintaining the relationship.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment of Invariant:**
The invariant is established before the first iteration of the loop. Initially:
- `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, thus `sn = i - 1` holds true (0 = 1 - 1).

**Pre-condition Guarantee:**
The pre-condition (initial values of `i` and `sn`) guarantees that the invariant holds true before the first iteration since `sn` starts at 0 when `i` is 1.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation of Invariant:**
The invariant is preserved during each iteration. If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `sn = i - 1`), then:
- After executing `sn = (sn + 1);`, `sn` becomes `i` (because it increments by 1).
- After executing `i = (i + 1);`, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- Thus, at the beginning of the next iteration, `sn` will equal `i - 1` again.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `i = 9` and `sn = 8`. The loop condition `i <= 8` becomes false, causing the loop to exit.

**Invariant Validity on Termination:**
The invariant `sn = i - 1` holds true upon termination because:
- At termination, `sn = 8` and `i = 9`, thus `8 = 9 - 1` is valid.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
The provided post-condition states: `assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);`. This is correct because:
- If `sn` is not equal to 0, it implies the loop executed at least once.
- Given that the loop runs from 1 to 8, if it has executed, `sn` must equal 8 when the loop terminates.

**Invariant and Post-condition:**
The invariant and the negation of the loop condition (which indicates the loop has terminated) collectively ensure that `sn` must be 8 if it is not 0, thus confirming the post-condition is met.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not add loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
