---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

#### Purpose:
The purpose of the loop is unclear due to the presence of the `unknown()` function, which introduces nondeterminism. However, the loop appears to modify the variable `c` based on certain conditions. Specifically:
- If `unknown()` returns true and `c > n`, then `c` is incremented.
- If `unknown()` returns false and `c == n`, then `c` is reset to 1.

The intended outcome seems to involve maintaining or resetting the value of `c` based on its relationship with `n`, but the exact purpose is ambiguous without more context.

#### Structure:
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues as long as `unknown()` returns true. Since `unknown()` is nondeterministic, the loop may run indefinitely or terminate at any time.
- **Operations Performed in the Body:**
  - If `unknown()` returns true and `c > n`, increment `c`.
  - If `unknown()` returns false and `c == n`, reset `c` to 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `c`: An integer variable that is modified within the loop.
  - `n`: An integer parameter passed to the function, which remains constant throughout the loop.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

#### Pre-Loop Sampling:
Before the loop begins:
- `c = 0` (initialized explicitly).
- `n > 0` (guaranteed by the precondition).

#### Post-Iteration Sampling:
The values of `c` after each iteration depend on the nondeterministic behavior of `unknown()`. Here is a possible sequence of values for `c` over five iterations:

1. **Iteration 1:**
   - If `unknown()` returns true and `c > n` (false initially since `c = 0`), `c` remains unchanged.
   - If `unknown()` returns false and `c == n` (false initially since `c = 0`), `c` remains unchanged.
   - Result: `c = 0`.

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - Same reasoning as above; `c` remains unchanged.
   - Result: `c = 0`.

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - Same reasoning as above; `c` remains unchanged.
   - Result: `c = 0`.

4. **Iteration 4:**
   - Same reasoning as above; `c` remains unchanged.
   - Result: `c = 0`.

5. **Iteration 5:**
   - Same reasoning as above; `c` remains unchanged.
   - Result: `c = 0`.

#### Post-Loop Sampling:
If the loop terminates, `c` will remain unchanged at 0. This is because none of the conditions in the loop body are satisfied when `c = 0`.

---

### c. Loop Invariant Discussion

#### Proposed Loop Invariant:
**Invariant:** `c >= 0` and `c <= n`.

#### Explanation:
- The variable `c` is initialized to 0, which satisfies the invariant (`c >= 0` and `c <= n`).
- Within the loop:
  - If `c > n`, `c` is incremented. However, this condition can only occur if `c` was already greater than `n`, which violates the invariant. Therefore, the invariant ensures that this branch cannot execute.
  - If `c == n`, `c` is reset to 1, which satisfies the invariant (`1 >= 0` and `1 <= n`).
  - In all other cases, `c` remains unchanged, preserving the invariant.

---

### d. Establishment

The invariant `c >= 0` and `c <= n` is established before the first iteration:
- Initially, `c = 0`, which satisfies `c >= 0` and `c <= n`.
- The precondition `n > 0` ensures that `c <= n` holds.

---

### e. Preservation

The invariant is preserved during each iteration:
- If `c > n`, the condition `c > n` is false (due to the invariant), so `c` is not incremented.
- If `c == n`, `c` is reset to 1, which satisfies the invariant.
- In all other cases, `c` remains unchanged, so the invariant continues to hold.

Thus, if the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, it will hold at the end of the iteration as well.

---

### f. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false. At this point:
- The invariant `c >= 0` and `c <= n` remains valid, as no operations in the loop body violate it.

---

### g. Post-condition Correctness

No explicit post-condition is provided in the code. However, based on the invariant, we can conclude that upon loop termination:
- `c` satisfies `c >= 0` and `c <= n`.

If a post-condition were to be defined, it could involve constraints on `c` that align with the invariant.

---

### Summary of Analysis

The loop invariant `c >= 0` and `c <= n` is valid and holds throughout the execution of the loop. The nondeterministic nature of `unknown()` makes it difficult to predict the exact behavior of the loop, but the invariant ensures that `c` remains within a well-defined range.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:

- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- Do not modify the the existing annotations template. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop with appropriate logical expressions to make the invariants meaningful and valid.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
