#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

**Purpose:**
The loop is designed to iterate through values of `x` from `1` to `100`, incrementing `x` by `1` in each iteration. During each iteration, the value of `y` is updated to `100 - x`. The loop essentially computes the difference between `100` and the current value of `x` for each iteration.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x <= 100)`  
  The loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to `100`.
- **Operations in the Body:**
  - `y = 100 - x;`  
    This assigns to `y` the value of `100 - x`.
  - `x = x + 1;`  
    This increments the value of `x` by `1`.
- **Relevant Variables:**  
  - `x`: Controls the loop's progression and termination.
  - `y`: Stores the computed value `100 - x` for each iteration.

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
Before the loop begins:
- `x = 1` (initialized).
- `y` is uninitialized (its value is indeterminate).

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**  
- **Iteration 1:**  
  - Before the loop body: `x = 1`.  
  - Inside the loop body: `y = 100 - 1 = 99`, `x = x + 1 = 2`.  
  - After the loop body: `x = 2`, `y = 99`.

- **Iteration 2:**  
  - Before the loop body: `x = 2`.  
  - Inside the loop body: `y = 100 - 2 = 98`, `x = x + 1 = 3`.  
  - After the loop body: `x = 3`, `y = 98`.

- **Iteration 3:**  
  - Before the loop body: `x = 3`.  
  - Inside the loop body: `y = 100 - 3 = 97`, `x = x + 1 = 4`.  
  - After the loop body: `x = 4`, `y = 97`.

- **Iteration 4:**  
  - Before the loop body: `x = 4`.  
  - Inside the loop body: `y = 100 - 4 = 96`, `x = x + 1 = 5`.  
  - After the loop body: `x = 5`, `y = 96`.

- **Iteration 5:**  
  - Before the loop body: `x = 5`.  
  - Inside the loop body: `y = 100 - 5 = 95`, `x = x + 1 = 6`.  
  - After the loop body: `x = 6`, `y = 95`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
When the loop terminates:
- The loop exits when `x = 101` (since `x <= 100` is false).
- Final values:  
  - `x = 101`.  
  - `y = 100 - 100 = 0` (from the last iteration before termination).

---

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
At the start of each iteration, the following invariant holds:  
`y = 100 - (x - 1)`  

**Explanation:**  
- Before the first iteration, `x = 1`, and `y` is computed as `100 - 1 = 99`. This satisfies the invariant: `y = 100 - (x - 1) = 100 - (1 - 1) = 99`.
- During each iteration, `x` is incremented by `1`, and `y` is updated to `100 - x`. The invariant continues to hold because `y` represents the difference between `100` and the previous value of `x` (`x - 1`).

---

#### e. Establishment ####

**Invariant Establishment:**  
- Initially, `x = 1`.  
- Before the first iteration, the loop invariant `y = 100 - (x - 1)` holds because `y = 100 - (1 - 1) = 100 - 0 = 99`.  
- The invariant is established as a direct consequence of the initial value of `x` and the computation of `y` in the loop body.

**Pre-condition:**  
The loop starts with `x = 1`, which guarantees that the invariant holds before the first iteration.

---

#### f. Preservation ####

**Invariant Preservation:**  
To prove preservation, we assume the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration and show it remains true after the iteration:  
1. At the start of an iteration, `y = 100 - (x - 1)`.  
2. Inside the loop body:
   - `y` is updated to `100 - x`.
   - `x` is incremented by `1` (`x = x + 1`).
3. After the loop body:
   - The new value of `y` is `100 - x`.
   - The new value of `x` is `x + 1`.  
   Substituting the updated values into the invariant:  
   `y = 100 - (x - 1)`  
   This shows the invariant is preserved.

---

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

**Termination Condition:**  
The loop terminates when `x > 100`. Specifically, the loop exits when `x = 101`.

**State at Termination:**  
- `x = 101`.  
- `y = 100 - 100 = 0` (from the last iteration before termination).

**Invariant Validity at Termination:**  
At termination, the loop invariant remains valid:
- `y = 100 - (x - 1)`  
- Substituting `x = 101`:  
  `y = 100 - (101 - 1) = 100 - 100 = 0`.  
  This matches the computed value of `y` in the last iteration.

---

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

**Post-condition:**  
The code does not explicitly specify a post-condition, but based on the loop's behavior, we can infer the following post-condition:  
- `x > 100`  
- `y = 100 - (x - 1)`  

**Correctness Evaluation:**  
- When the loop exits, `x = 101`, which satisfies `x > 100`.  
- At termination, `y = 100 - (x - 1)` evaluates to `y = 100 - (101 - 1) = 0`, which matches the computed value.  

**Conclusion:**  
The inferred post-condition is correct. The loop invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x > 100`), ensures the post-condition is met.

--- 

### Final Remarks ###

The loop invariant `y = 100 - (x - 1)` is valid and holds throughout the execution of the loop. It is established before the first iteration, preserved during each iteration, and remains valid at termination. The loop correctly computes values of `y` based on `x`, and the inferred post-condition is consistent with the loop's behavior.
