#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of the loop is to incrementally compute the sum of integers from `0` to `999` (inclusive) and store the result in the variable `x`. The loop iterates while the value of `y` is less than `1000`, and during each iteration, `y` is incremented by `1` while `x` accumulates the current value of `y`.

**Structure:**  
- **Governing Condition:** The loop executes as long as `y < 1000`.  
- **Operations in the Body:**  
  - `x = x + y;` adds the current value of `y` to `x`.  
  - `y = y + 1;` increments `y` by 1.  
- **Relevant Variables:**  
  - `x`: Tracks the cumulative sum of integers up to the current value of `y`.  
  - `y`: Acts as the loop counter and determines the current integer being added to `x`.

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
Before the loop begins:
- `x = 1`  
- `y = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**  
- **Iteration 1:**  
  - Before iteration: `x = 1`, `y = 0`  
  - After iteration: `x = 1 + 0 = 1`, `y = 0 + 1 = 1`  

- **Iteration 2:**  
  - Before iteration: `x = 1`, `y = 1`  
  - After iteration: `x = 1 + 1 = 2`, `y = 1 + 1 = 2`  

- **Iteration 3:**  
  - Before iteration: `x = 2`, `y = 2`  
  - After iteration: `x = 2 + 2 = 4`, `y = 2 + 1 = 3`  

- **Iteration 4:**  
  - Before iteration: `x = 4`, `y = 3`  
  - After iteration: `x = 4 + 3 = 7`, `y = 3 + 1 = 4`  

- **Iteration 5:**  
  - Before iteration: `x = 7`, `y = 4`  
  - After iteration: `x = 7 + 4 = 11`, `y = 4 + 1 = 5`  

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
When the loop terminates (`y >= 1000`):
- `y = 1000`  
- `x = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 999 = 499501`  

---

#### c. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
At the beginning of each iteration, `x` is equal to `1 + (sum of all integers from `0` to `y - 1`)`.

**Explanation of Validity:**  
This invariant is valid because:
1. At the start of the loop (`y = 0`), `x = 1` satisfies the invariant since there are no integers to sum (`sum of integers from 0 to -1 is 0`).  
2. During each iteration, `x` is updated by adding the current value of `y`, which extends the sum of integers from `0` to `y`.  
3. The invariant remains true throughout the loop, as the loop operations directly maintain the relationship between `x` and the sum of integers up to `y`.

---

#### d. Establishment ####

**Establishment of Invariant:**  
Before the first iteration:
- `x = 1`  
- `y = 0`  
The invariant holds because `x = 1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `y - 1`)` translates to `x = 1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `-1`) = 1`.

**Pre-condition Guarantee:**  
The initial values of `x = 1` and `y = 0` ensure that the invariant holds true before the loop begins.

---

#### e. Preservation ####

**Preservation of Invariant:**  
If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, it will hold at the end of the iteration as follows:
1. **Before iteration:**  
   - `x = 1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `y - 1`)`  
   - `y` is the current loop counter.  

2. **During iteration:**  
   - `x` is updated as `x = x + y`, which adds the current value of `y` to the sum.  
   - `y` is incremented as `y = y + 1`.  

3. **After iteration:**  
   - `x = 1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `y - 1`)` is maintained because `x` now includes the sum of integers from `0` to the updated value of `y - 1`.  

Thus, the invariant is preserved.

---

#### f. Termination Analysis ####

**Termination Condition:**  
The loop terminates when `y >= 1000`. At this point:
- `y = 1000`  
- `x = 1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `999`) = 499501`  

**Invariant at Termination:**  
The invariant remains valid because `x` correctly represents `1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `y - 1`)`, and `y - 1 = 999`.

---

#### g. Post-condition Correctness ####

**Post-condition:**  
`assert x >= y;`

**Correctness:**  
The post-condition is correct because:
1. At the end of the loop, `x = 499501` and `y = 1000`.  
2. Clearly, `x >= y` holds true (`499501 >= 1000`).  

**Proof Using Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:**  
- The invariant ensures that `x = 1 + (sum of integers from `0` to `y - 1`)`.  
- When the loop terminates, `y = 1000`, and the sum of integers from `0` to `999` is a large positive value (`499500`). Adding `1` ensures that `x` is much greater than `y`.  
- The negation of the loop condition (`y >= 1000`) guarantees that `y` has reached or exceeded the termination threshold, and the invariant confirms that `x` has accumulated all required values.

Thus, the post-condition is valid.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
