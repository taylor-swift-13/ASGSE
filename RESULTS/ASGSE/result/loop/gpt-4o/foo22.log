#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

**Purpose:**  
The loop iterates over values of `x` from 1 to 100. During each iteration, the variable `y` is updated as `y = 100 - x`. The intended outcome is that `x` reaches 101, causing the loop to terminate, while `y` holds the value `100 - x` from the last iteration.

**Structure:**  
- **Loop Condition:** `while (x <= 100)`  
  The loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.  
- **Loop Body:**  
  - `y = 100 - x;`  
    Updates `y` to the difference between 100 and the current value of `x`.  
  - `x = x + 1;`  
    Increments `x` by 1.  
- **Relevant Variables:**  
  - `x`: The loop counter, initialized to 1, and incremented by 1 in each iteration.  
  - `y`: A variable dependent on `x`, updated in each iteration to `100 - x`.

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
Before the loop begins:  
- `x = 1` (initialized)  
- `y` is uninitialized (its value is indeterminate).

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**  
After each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are as follows:  

| Iteration | `x` (before iteration) | `y` (before iteration) | `x` (after iteration) | `y` (after iteration) |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1         | 1                       | Uninitialized           | 2                      | 99                     |
| 2         | 2                       | 99                      | 3                      | 98                     |
| 3         | 3                       | 98                      | 4                      | 97                     |
| 4         | 4                       | 97                      | 5                      | 96                     |
| 5         | 5                       | 96                      | 6                      | 95                     |

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
When the loop terminates:  
- `x = 101` (the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false).  
- `y = 100 - x = 100 - 101 = -1`.

---

#### c. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
At the start of each iteration:  
`y = 100 - x`  

**Explanation:**  
The loop invariant states that `y` is always equal to the difference between 100 and the current value of `x`. This invariant is valid because:  
1. Before the loop starts, `x = 1` and `y` is immediately set to `100 - x = 99`.  
2. In each iteration, the loop body updates `y` to `100 - x` after incrementing `x`.  
3. The loop condition ensures that `x` remains within the range `[1, 100]` during the iterations, and the invariant holds true throughout.

---

#### d. Establishment ####

**How the Invariant is Established:**  
Before the first iteration:  
- `x = 1` (initialized).  
- `y` is set to `100 - x = 100 - 1 = 99`.  
Thus, the invariant `y = 100 - x` holds true before the first iteration.

**Pre-condition Guarantee:**  
The pre-condition for the loop is that `x` is initialized to 1, and the loop condition `x <= 100` is true. This ensures that the loop begins in a valid state, where the invariant can be established.

---

#### e. Preservation ####

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**  
During each iteration:  
1. At the start of the iteration, the invariant `y = 100 - x` holds.  
2. The loop body updates `y` to `100 - x` (explicitly setting it).  
3. The loop increments `x` by 1 (`x = x + 1`).  
4. At the end of the iteration, the invariant `y = 100 - x` still holds for the updated value of `x`.  

**Proof:**  
If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, the loop body ensures that `y` is updated to match the current value of `100 - x`. The increment of `x` does not affect the validity of the invariant, as `y` is explicitly recalculated in each iteration.

---

#### f. Termination Analysis ####

**State of Variables at Termination:**  
When the loop terminates:  
- `x = 101` (the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false).  
- `y = 100 - x = 100 - 101 = -1`.

**Invariant Validity at Termination:**  
The invariant `y = 100 - x` remains valid even at termination, as `y` is calculated based on the final value of `x` before the loop exits.

---

#### g. Post-condition Correctness ####

**Provided Post-condition:**  
`assert (y < 100);`

**Evaluation:**  
The post-condition is correct. At the end of the loop:  
- `x = 101`.  
- `y = 100 - x = -1`.  
Since `y = -1`, it satisfies the condition `y < 100`.

**Proof Using Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:**  
- The invariant `y = 100 - x` holds throughout the loop.  
- The loop terminates when `x = 101`, making the loop condition `x <= 100` false.  
- Substituting `x = 101` into the invariant: `y = 100 - x = -1`.  
- Thus, `y < 100` is guaranteed upon loop termination.

---

### Final Remarks ###
The loop invariant `y = 100 - x` is valid and correctly established, preserved, and maintained throughout the loop's execution. The post-condition `assert (y < 100)` is also correct and proven using the invariant and termination conditions.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
