#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo103` is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value of 0 to 100. The intended outcome of the loop is that after its completion, the value of `x` will be exactly 100.

The structure of the loop is defined by the following components:
- **Governing Condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as `x < 100`.
- **Operations in the Body**: Within the loop body, the operation `x = (x + 1);` is performed, which increments the value of `x` by 1 during each iteration.
- **Relevant Variables**: The primary variable relevant to the loop's behavior is `x`, which is an integer initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Before the loop begins, `x = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After iteration 1: `x = 1` (0 + 1)
  - After iteration 2: `x = 2` (1 + 1)
  - After iteration 3: `x = 3` (2 + 1)
  - After iteration 4: `x = 4` (3 + 1)
  - After iteration 5: `x = 5` (4 + 1)

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - After the loop terminates: `x = 100` (after 100 iterations).

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, the invariant is: `x >= 0` and `x <= 100`.

- **Explanation of Validity**: This invariant is valid because:
  - Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to 0, satisfying `x >= 0`.
  - During each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, ensuring it remains non-negative.
  - The loop condition (`x < 100`) guarantees that `x` cannot exceed 99 while the loop is running, thus `x <= 100` holds true throughout the loop's execution.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: The invariant is established before the first iteration as follows:
  - At the start, `x` is initialized to 0, which satisfies both parts of the invariant (`x >= 0` and `x <= 100`).

- **Pre-condition Guarantee**: The pre-condition (initialization of `x` to 0) ensures that the invariant holds true before the first iteration begins.

#### f. Preservation

- **Invariant Preservation**: The invariant is preserved throughout the loop:
  - Assume the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `x >= 0` and `x <= 100`).
  - At the end of the iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, making `x` equal to `x + 1`.
  - Since `x` was less than 100 before the increment, `x + 1` is still less than or equal to 100, thus preserving `x <= 100`.
  - Additionally, since `x` was non-negative, `x + 1` remains non-negative, thus preserving `x >= 0`.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination**: When the loop terminates, the condition `x < 100` becomes false. This means `x` must be equal to 100 because the last increment occurred when `x` was 99.

- **Validity of Invariant at Termination**: At termination, the invariant still holds as `x` is exactly 100, which satisfies the condition `x >= 0` and `x <= 100`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: The provided post-condition `assert x == 100;` is correct.

- **Proof of Post-condition**: The loop invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition (`x < 100` is false), confirms that `x` must equal 100 at the end of the loop. Thus, the post-condition is satisfied, proving that `x` indeed equals 100 when the loop completes.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not add loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
