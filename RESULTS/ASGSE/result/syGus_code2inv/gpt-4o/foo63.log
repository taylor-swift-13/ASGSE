#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this loop is to iteratively update the variable `y` based on the current value of `x`. Specifically, `y` is assigned the value `10 - x` during each iteration, and `x` is incremented by 1. The loop continues until `x` exceeds 10. The final value of `y` when the loop terminates is expected to satisfy the post-condition `y >= 0`.

**Structure:**  
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x <= 10)` — The loop executes as long as `x` is less than or equal to 10.
- **Body of the Loop:**  
  1. `y = 10 - x;` — The variable `y` is updated to `10 - x`.
  2. `x = x + 1;` — The variable `x` is incremented by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**  
  - `x`: A counter variable initialized to 1, which controls the number of iterations.
  - `y`: A variable that is updated during each iteration based on the current value of `x`.

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
- Initial values of variables:
  - `x = 1`
  - `y` is uninitialized (its value is irrelevant before the loop starts).

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**  
- Iteration 1 (after first iteration):
  - `x = 2`
  - `y = 10 - 1 = 9`

- Iteration 2:
  - `x = 3`
  - `y = 10 - 2 = 8`

- Iteration 3:
  - `x = 4`
  - `y = 10 - 3 = 7`

- Iteration 4:
  - `x = 5`
  - `y = 10 - 4 = 6`

- Iteration 5:
  - `x = 6`
  - `y = 10 - 5 = 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
- The loop terminates when `x > 10`. The final values are:
  - `x = 11`
  - `y = 10 - 10 = 0`

---

#### c. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, the following condition holds:  
`y = 10 - (x - 1)`  
In natural language, this means that `y` always represents the value `10` minus the previous value of `x` before it was incremented.

**Explanation of Validity:**  
This invariant is valid because:
1. At the start of the loop, `x = 1`, so `y = 10 - (x - 1) = 10 - 0 = 10`, which matches the initial state.
2. During each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is updated to `10 - x`. This ensures that the invariant holds for the next iteration.
3. The invariant directly relates the values of `x` and `y` at every step of the loop.

---

#### d. Establishment ####

**Establishment of the Invariant:**  
Before the first iteration of the loop:
- `x = 1` (initialized before the loop).
- `y` is uninitialized, but it is immediately updated to `10 - x` in the first iteration.
- After this update, `y = 10 - 1 = 9`, which satisfies the invariant `y = 10 - (x - 1)`.

**Pre-Condition Guarantee:**  
The pre-condition for the loop (`x = 1` and `y` is updated during the first iteration) ensures that the invariant is established before the loop begins.

---

#### e. Preservation ####

**Preservation of the Invariant:**  
To prove that the invariant is preserved:
1. Assume the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, i.e., `y = 10 - (x - 1)`.
2. During the iteration:
   - `y` is updated to `10 - x`.
   - `x` is incremented by 1 (`x = x + 1`).
3. At the end of the iteration:
   - The new value of `y` becomes `10 - (x - 1)`, which matches the invariant for the next iteration.

Thus, if the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, it will hold at the end of that iteration as well.

---

#### f. Termination Analysis ####

**Termination Condition:**  
The loop terminates when `x > 10`. This occurs after 10 iterations, at which point:
- `x = 11`
- `y = 10 - 10 = 0`

**Invariant at Termination:**  
At termination, the invariant `y = 10 - (x - 1)` still holds. Substituting the final value of `x`:
- `y = 10 - (11 - 1) = 10 - 10 = 0`.

---

#### g. Post-Condition Correctness ####

**Post-Condition Evaluation:**  
The post-condition is `y >= 0`. At the end of the loop:
- `y = 0`, which satisfies `y >= 0`.

**Proof of Post-Condition:**  
The invariant `y = 10 - (x - 1)` ensures that `y` decreases linearly as `x` increases. When the loop terminates, `x = 11`, and the invariant guarantees that `y = 0`. Since `0 >= 0`, the post-condition is met.

---

### Summary ###
The loop invariant `y = 10 - (x - 1)` is valid, correctly established, and preserved throughout the loop. The loop terminates when `x > 10`, and the post-condition `y >= 0` is satisfied.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

Rules:
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to repalce the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
