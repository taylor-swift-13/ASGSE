    The key insight is that `s` represents the sum of the first `a+1` odd numbers, which equals `(a+1)Â²`.;
    Looking at this loop, I need to analyze the variables and their relationships:;
    - `t` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration;
    - `s` starts at 1 and gets updated to `s + t` each iteration;
    - `a` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration;
    - The loop continues while `s <= n`;
