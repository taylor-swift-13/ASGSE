    Looking at this loop, I need to analyze the variables and their relationships:
    
    - `a` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration
    - `s` starts at 1 and gets updated to `s + t` each iteration
    - `t` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration
    - The loop continues while `s <= n`
    
    The key insight is that `s` represents the sum of the first `a+1` odd numbers, which equals `(a+1)Â²`.
    
    ```c
    loop invariant s == (a + 1) * (a + 1);
    loop invariant t == 2 * a + 1;
    loop invariant a >= 0;
    loop invariant s >= 1;
    loop assigns a;
    loop assigns s;  
    loop assigns t;
    ```

     a=a+1;

    // post-condition
