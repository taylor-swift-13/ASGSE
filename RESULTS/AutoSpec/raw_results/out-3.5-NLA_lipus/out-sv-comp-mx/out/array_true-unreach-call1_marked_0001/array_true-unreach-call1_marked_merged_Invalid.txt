  this is possibly due to missing preprocessor flags;
  consider options -cpp-extra-args, -json-compilation-database or -cpp-command.
  See chapter "Preparing the Sources" in the Frama-C user manual for more details.
[kernel] User Error: stopping on
  file "out/array_true-unreach-call1_marked_0001/array_true-unreach-call1_marked_merged.c"
  that has errors. Add '-kernel-msg-key pp' for preprocessing command.
